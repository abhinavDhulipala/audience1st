Feature: dedicated landing page for online donations

  As a patron
  So that I can support the theater's various missions
  I want to easily make online donations and know what fund they're supporting

Background:

  Given the following account codes exist:
  | name             | code | description                                                     | donation_prompt          |
  | History Fund     | 7575 | The History Fund supports exhibits about the theater's history. |                          |
  | Show Sponsorship | 8080 | Sponsorship of Altarena productions                             | Name of show to sponsor: |
  And I am logged in as customer "Tom Foolery"

Scenario: landing on donation page with valid account code
  When I visit the donation landing page coded for fund 7575
  Then I should see "Donation to History Fund"
  And I should see "exhibits about the theater's history"
  When I fill in "donation" with "65"
  And I press "submit"
  Then I should be on the Checkout page
  And I should see "Donation to History Fund"
  And I should see "$65.00"

Scenario: not filling in a donation amount should return you to donation page
  When I visit the donation landing page coded for fund 7575
  And  I press "submit"
  Then I should see "Donation to History Fund"

Scenario: landing on donation page with invalid account code
  When I visit the donation landing page coded for a nonexistent fund
