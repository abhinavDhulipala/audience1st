%h1 Change label name

%p.explanation
  You can change the name of the label and it will still be attached
  to the same customers it was before.

= form_for(@label) do |f| 
  = f.label :name
  = f.text_field :name
  = f.submit 'Update'
  = link_to 'Cancel', labels_path, :class => 'btn btn-secondary'
